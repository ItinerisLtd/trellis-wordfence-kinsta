## Requirements

- Trellis [6b40320](https://github.com/roots/trellis/commit/7cdfbde363b8f8b1947fbd4ea28ba31af2067f6d) or later
- Ansible v2.6 or later
- Bedrock
- WordFence

## Installation

Add this role to `galaxy.yml`:
```yaml
# galaxy.yml
- src: https://github.com/ItinerisLtd/trellis-wordfence-kinsta
  version: x.x.x # Check for latest version!
```

Run the command:
```bash
trellis galaxy install

# Alternatively
ansible-galaxy install -r galaxy.yml --force
```

## Role Variables

1. Add this role to the [`deploy_after` hook](https://roots.io/trellis/docs/deploys/#hooks):
    ```yaml
    # group_vars/all/deploy-hooks.yml
    # Learn more on https://roots.io/trellis/docs/deploys/#hooks
    deploy_after:
      - "{{ playbook_dir }}/vendor/roles/itinerisltd.trellis-wordfence-kinsta/tasks/main.yml"
    ```

## Usage

1. Setup the [role variables](#role-variables)
2. [Deploy](https://roots.io/trellis/docs/deploys/#example)
3. Tell Kinsta to add the `auto_prepend_file` variable that points to `{{ deploy_helper.current_path }}/web/wp/wordfence-waf.php`
    1. `deploy_helper.shared_path` can differ between Trellis setups. Check for final path before asking Kinsta.
    2. This is usually where the uploads are stored.
    3. E.g. `auto_prepend_file = '/www/kinstauser_123/public/current/web/wp/wordfence-waf.php'`

## FAQs

### WordFence still complains that the firewall is not configured!

Do not forget to tell Kinsta to add the `auto_prepend_file` variable.

## Testing

### Syntax Check

```bash
âžœ ansible-playbook -i 'localhost,' --syntax-check tests/test.yml
